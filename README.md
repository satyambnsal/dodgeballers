# DodgeBallers: **thrilling duels to find a hidden ball behind a cup**

Dodgeballers is a blockchain-based game where players, armed with their unique Blobert NFTs, engage in thrilling duels to find a hidden ball behind a cup. Each player receives five chances per round, and the one who wins the most rounds emerges victorious. The game features various modes, challenges, and power-ups to keep players engaged. Traits of the Blobert NFTs, including armor, background, jewelry, mask, and weapon, are gamified to enhance gameplay and strategy. Rewards such as rare items and special NFTs are offered for winning duels, while consequences such as temporary penalties are incurred for losing.
